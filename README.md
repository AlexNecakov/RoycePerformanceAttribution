# Royce Performance Visualizer and Attribution Dashboard - 2018/2019
Archived here is documentation I wrote up for the Performance Visualizer and Attribution Dashboards that I made during my internships at Royce Investment Partners during Summer 2018 and Summer 2019. These dashboards were made in Tableau and hook into Royce's performance SQL databases, allowing users to make better use of their data in a visual format. These dashboards are fully featured, with customizable visuals and graphics allowing for many different insights to be gained and shared with the company. The Performance Visualizer allows users to view performance data in table and graphical formats, with many additional charts accessible within a single dashboard. These additional graphics were added to the dashboard using dashboard actions and parameter processing. The dashboard is fed extracted data, schedule every morning so as to allow users to always have up to date information during the work day. The attribution dashboard is another powerful tool that allows users to view what factors lead to fund performance in a graphical format. This data can be broken down and viewed in different granularity levels, from Sector, all the way down to individual Fund performance. Both of these workbooks were initially developed by myself during my time at Royce, along with necessary documentation to hand-off further maintenance and development to full-time developers.
